Wow, it really was a long time since the last tutorial. I've had more and more to do in school
and other things have popped up, maybe I just needed a break too. Now I really feel up to
writing again, thanks to some encouragement on the Atari forum (http://www.atari-forum.com/).

This here tutorial will be the follow up of the previous one, in which I promised to tell you
how to play the `.ym` files of the ST-sound format from Arnaud Carré. It will be quite easy and
a bit of a soft start actually. The focus lies not so much on the code, but how to find and
apply knowledge.

Like I always say, I am no musician, neither am I an artist, so therefore, I need to rip stuff or
have it made for me. I have loads of `.ym` files on my PC, which can be played by using a
plug-in for Winamp. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to use this wealth of music? Yes it would, I
wonder how that can be achieved, here's how.

In order to use the files, we need information on the file format. See <<tutorial-06#,tutorial 6>>
for a quick refresh on files if that's needed. Load up a good search engine in the browser,
I used Google (http://www.google.com/). Now we want to find info on the `.ym` file format,
so a search string of "ym file format" would seem appropriate. Would you look at that, the
first find seems good, taking us to http://leonard.oxg.free.fr/ymformat.html. Quickly browsing
the side, we judge it seems to hold what we need. We also discover the file format is freeware,
so there's no need to worry about the cops.
Hum hum, there seem to be different versions of the file format, didn't know that... hum
hum, this information only applies to YM6, the latest version. "So YM6 is just a register dump
file", this is an important key, it tells us how the file format works. It seems that an `.ym` file is
simply a dump of the data used to play a song, but that's not enough, we need to know how
the data is organized. Reading on... Ah, `.ym` files are packed using LHA, so that's why they
are so small. Using the freeware UltimateZip (http://www.ultimatezip.com/), an `.ym` file can
be unpacked, or any other LHA packer, but UltimateZip is my choice of program.

Reading ever further down the page... ah, here it comes. The `.ym` file contains 16 bytes of
data for each frame, interleaved. Sure, the sound chip has 16 registers, so by just putting the
data into the registers of the sound chip, music should be played. Lastly, there's some info on
the file header. Some files have headers that tell of important information for the rest of the
file, here for example, it's nice to know how long a song actually is. There's some talk about
digi-drums and so, that will not be covered in this tutorial and you are welcome to explore it
yourself.

So, now we have all the information we need, we just have to structure it and go through it.
Load up the included `.ym` file `jamblv1.ym` in your favourite hex-editor. It's also possible to
put it in an otherwise empty source file, assemble it and go into the debugger like this

It seems that every program starts with two bytes of data that would overwrite the data in
`jamblv1.ym`, that's what the NOP is there for. By hitting tab once to get into the memory
window, you can use the arrow keys to scroll up and down in the `jamblv1.ym` file. Now we'll
traverse the file and see if it corresponds to the information we have on what the file should
look like. It starts with the values `$59`, `$4d` and `$21`, which identifies the file as an YM6 file.
When interpreted as ASCII (numbers to letters), these numbers become the letters Y, M and
!. Next follows a test string, "LeOnArD!", all good so far.

After the initial check-things comes the interesting information, a long (4 bytes) that tells us
the number of frames in the file. In this case, it's a value of `$0000bea`, which corresponds to
3050 in decimal. Note that I wrote out the leading two bytes that for now only contain zeros,
but they are important to count otherwise you'll get lost. What does this mean exactly? Well,
frame of music is just like a frame of graphics, the ST usually operates at 50 Hertz which
equals 50 frames per second. So we divide 3050 by 50 and get the value 61, indicating the
tune should be 1:01 long. Load it up in Winamp to test, yep, seems to be right.

Next comes four bytes of song attributes, that I have no idea what it is, but zero seems to be
a safe value, and two bytes of digi-drums, which are also zero. Some files have a song
attribute of one, and they seem to work fine to. You'll have to experiment with this yourself if
you find songs that should use digi-drums, or mail LeOnArD! Another uninteresting value,
`$001e8480`, or 2000000, which seems to indicate this is indeed an Atari tune. Then two
bytes, telling us the tune is operating at a frequency of 50 Hz. Lastly an additional six bytes
of zero data.

Right, you with me so far? It's just a question of slowly going through the file and check that
everything is in order and corresponds to the information we have. Of course it is in order,
otherwise the file wouldn't work in Winamp, but I want to make sure for myself. Now comes
some text again, according to Leonard's page, these are the song name, author name and
song comment.

The data is in null terminated string format. This means the strings can be variable in length,
and ends with the value zero. Quite true, after each little string, we can see zeroes shining
through. After these strings, the real sound data begins, also of unknown length. However,
since we know that there are 3050 frames of data, and each frame holds 16 bytes of sound
data, there are 3050 × 16 = 48800 bytes of data here, this calculation also seems correct
since this is roughly the file size. At the end, there are also four bytes forming the string
"End!".

So what do we really need here? Two things, the number of frames, to know how long the
music file is, so we know when to terminate play, or loop the song, and the start address of
the music data. We know the address of the number of frames, so that's easy to just store in
a variable. Getting to the music data is trickier, since we don't know exactly where it is. Sure,
we can hexedit the file and then hardcode the address into the program, but a more general
way of finding the music start data would be nice, so that we easily can play many different
`.ym` files without having to check the start address of the sound data for each file.

What we want is to get to the end of the three text strings, because this is where the sound
data begins (if you don't have any digi-drums). To do this, we put ourselves at the beginning
of the text field, which always start at the same place, and then we check each byte for a
zero, since this means the end of a string, and do this three times. In so doing, we will have
passed by all the three text strings, like so

                move.l  a0, music                 ; skipped 3 zero, store address

Now we have the length of the tune in frames, and the start address for the sound data in
music. What was that about interleaved data? The thing is, that many registers of the sound
chip are all zero. In order to compress better, it would be nice to have all these zeros in one
long row. Therefore, the data is not presented in the order it's supposed to be inserted in the
sound chip, rather, the data is presented one full register after another. Thus, in our file,
there is 3050 bytes of register 0 data, then 3050 bytes of register 1 data and so on.

When we put the sound data in the yammy, we have to add the number of frames for each
input. In this way, we will first input data from register 0, and then we skip the number of
frames to reach the data for the next register and so on. Here's the entire code, the code for
the VU bars has already been discussed and is only included here for fun, so there is very
little new code

I start off with a normal setup, then read in the music data as described previously and start
the main routine. The main routine here has the actual routine for playing the tune, and the
rest of the code is just VU bars.

First, make `a0` point to the current music data, this is somewhere in the music file (on a
number of frames boundary), then put the yammy register number in `d0`. The real routine for
actually getting the sound data into the yammy is very compact. `d0` holds the number of the
register to manipulate, putting that in `$ff8800` lets us manipulate the register in question,
then I just put in the music data. After that, it's a question of adding the number of frames to
the music pointer, in order to point to the next register. Increment `d0` to point to the next
register, and do this 16 times, one time for each register. If you don't remember about the
sound chip, recheck <<tutorial-13#,tutorial 13>>.

Next I increment the music pointer, so that it points to the beginning of the next sound data
set, and increase the number of played frames by one. The last part of the main routine
checks to see if the number of played frames equals the number of frames, if this is so, I
subtract the number of frames from the music pointer. This makes the music pointer point to
the beginning of the music data again. The play time also needs to be reset of course, finally,
a jump to the VU routine, just for the visual effect. Not to complex when you think about it,
actually, I managed to get it right on the first compile... almost, I had a slight offset error.

The routine should work for any and all YM6 version files without anything fancy (digi-drums
etc), and perhaps even with some fancy stuff. I don't really know. Unfortunately it will not
play any other ym versions, you'll have to work that out yourself. In order to get any music
you want from any Atari source, you can use SainT to record the music in `.ym` format, it's
that simple.

With this routine, you could make yourself an `.ym` file player for the Atari. As the program is
now, it's really crappy, there is no error reporting of any kind for starters. Perhaps some
tunes really are in 60 Hertz, then they would play wrongly, or perhaps the file is something
other than YM6 probably resulting in a crash. You should add some error reporting yourself.

One nice thing to do with this is to just hook up the music to the VBL, then drop out of the
program (not waiting for a key press nor restoring the VBL). The music will still be playing
and you can go on coding. This is very unstable though, and doing this in the GEM desktop
will probably get you an immediate crash, doing this in Devpac will probably get you a crash
when you compile anything. It's just an idea to get you going.
