It has occurred to me that by striving ever forward, we've forgotten to speak about some
basic things, so for this tutorial and the next one, we'll be taking a step back and reviewing
some things. You may have guessed these techniques yourself, but it never hurts to have it
spelled out. Also, I thought I'd share some new thoughts on development, we'll take that
first.

Most of the source for the tutorials in the past I've actually written in Devpac on a real Atari,
but it has now become clear to me that developing in Windows on an IBM compatible is
easier and more efficient. I got the tip over at http://www.atari-forum.com/, a discussion forum for
all topics Atari (where I'm one of the moderators for the coding section, yay). Have one
"launcher file" with only one line

[source]
----
                include whateveryoursourcename.s
----

By doing this, you'll assemble any source files you want, and you can edit those source files
outside of Devpac, and then assemble them in Devpac. When I wrote this tutorial, I had a file
named `_WRAP.S` that had the line `include tut15.s` in it. Then I used Ultraedit (my editor of
choice) to edit `tut15.s`, I also had Devpac running under STEem. Whenever I felt like
assembling my source, I just saved in Ultraedit, `ALT+Tab`-bed into STEem and hit `ALT+a` to
assemble my source; smooth and easy.

Speaking of Ultraedit, there is a topic going on over at http://www.atari-forum.com/viewtopic.php?t=946
to try and work out good syntax highlighting for Atari assembly in Ultraedit (http://www.ultraedit.com/).
Wow, that's a lot of various things you wouldn't have seen pop up in a tutorial from say 1994.
Now onto the serious stuff.

The palette is an extremely powerful thing when you want to change colours quick and easy.
Unfortunately it has the obvious limitation of not changing the pixels. Using the palette you
can black out the screen without erasing the contents (by setting all colours to black), make
things pulse (by incrementing and decrementing colour intensity) or wait with displaying a
picture. Say you want to calculate a big fractal, just set the palette to all 0, calculate your
fractal, then whip in the palette to display the result. The effect will be that no one will see
you draw the fractal, only the final result will be shown.
As we've been through before, there are 16 colours in the palette, the first one being the
background colour, located at `$ff8240`. Each colour is a word long, making the palette end at
`$ff825e`. Each word is built up like this

The first three bits control blue intensity, then there's a zero bit, the next three bits control
green intensity, a zero and the final (non-zero) three bits control red intensity. The maximum
value you can get out of three bits is 8, and since the colour intensities are at 4 bit
boundaries, they are very easy to access in hex (since each character in hex mode is a 4 bit
quantity). Thus `$700` means max intensity of red and zero intensity for green and blue, `$444`
means medium intensity for all three colours.

When they built the STe, they thought that it would be nice to have more colours in the
palette, and indeed, it's easy to just add an additional bit since that would still have the
palette on a 4 bit boundary, making each colour range from 0-15. However, there was a
problem, they could not add a bit in the beginning and just shift the other bits to the left,
since that would mean all old palette values would in effect be shifted left one bit creating an
entirely different value than was originally intended.

The solution to this problem is cunning, but unfortunate. They added the least significant bit
where the zero bit used to be. This maintains backwards compatibility, and adds 8 new
possible colour intensities. So the STe palette looks like this

This means that $700 is still (almost) maximum intensity of red. What in the memory is
perceived as the most significant bit, is in palette terms the least significant bit. This sounds
very confusing perhaps, but just picture moving the uppermost bit of each colour intensity
first. Let's say then that we want the intensity between `$100` and `$200`, this would be colour
`$900`, since that would be

0000100100000000
----

Which we can interpret as

----
0000RRRrGGGgBBBb
0000001100000000
----

Thus, when using the STe palette, we must think about the fact that the most significant bit
for each colour, is in actuality the least significant bit. The number order for intensities, from
lowest to highest is 0, 8, 1, 9, 2, A, 3, B, 4, C, 5, D, 6, E, 7, F. So if you use colour `$fff`, the
STe will interpret this as intensity 15 for all colours, and the ST will interpret it as colour
intensity 7, since the ST doesn't care about whether the fourth bit is set or not.

That should be all there is to the palette, making full utilization of it will be up to each one. In
order to do something I thought we'd just do a simple fade in effect. Fading in a picture is so
much nicer than just whipping it onto screen. Fading out is also much nicer than just zapping
it away, you can also fade to white and make the screen sort of flash away.

What we want is to begin with a black palette and pixel data on the screen, then increment
the colour values of the palette until they reach the values intended for the picture. In order
to keep things simple, I opted to skip the STe palette since there's lots of shifting involved
whenever you want to use it. So the fade will only have a maximum of 7 intensities to work
with, making it a pretty bad looking fade effect.

We'll need a copy of the original palette, and a current palette which we increment until it
reaches the original. It would be tempting to compare the real palette to the current one and
add `$111` (one intensity of each colour) if they don't match, but that won't work. Say one
colour is supposed to be `$100`, if we compare our current `$000` with that, they don't match,
so we add `$111` making the current colour `$111`, which is more than `$100`. Instead, we must
compare each red, green and blue value individually. This can easily be done by just masking
off all bits except the three controlling the intensity for either red, green or blue.

Let's assume `d0` holds the real colour, and `d1` holds the temporary. All bits except the ones
controlling red are masked off, then values compared. If they do not match, add one to the
value. The value to add will be different depending on which intensity we check for, since
different intensities begin at different bit positions. That's pretty much it, here's the entire
source

First I save the palette of the picture in a storage space, then I put the temporary palette in,
since the temporary palette is initialised to all 0's, this has the effect of blacking out the
screen. Next I load up the picture as described in <<tutorial-06#,tutorial 6>> and set up
the main routine.

The counter code is for delay purposes; otherwise the fade effect would hardly be visible. I
make `a0` point to the palette to reach, and point `a1` to the temporary one. Then I check the
individual intensities, and add 2 to each pointer in order to point to the next colour, repeating
this for the number of colours in the palette, namely 16.

You will notice that the check sub-routines are a bit different than the one described above, I
add to the value pointed to by `a1`, which is the current palette. It may be considered slightly
bad program habit to just assume that `a1` points to the current palette like that, but coding
demos and assembly in general depends on tight kept code that knows what it's doing.
Besides, the tutorials aren't really for teaching you how to make good code; they are
intended as basic introductions to various coding techniques.

That's that, one easy effect achieved by manipulating the palette. If you want to fade to
white, just set the temporary palette to the real palette, and increment until you reach `$777`.
If you want to experiment, I suggest trying to implement the effect with a STe palette
instead, the included picture has a STe palette so it's ready to go. This should involve shifting
the fourth bit of each colour intensity down as the first when adding to the colour intensity,
and then shift it back. For the next tutorial, I think we'll handle full screen scrolling, without
moving any picture data!
