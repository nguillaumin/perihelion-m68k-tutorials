Yep, here we go again, this time I think we'll have a nice little tutorial on our hands, not that
big. It only concerns the workings of the joystick. It could've involved the mouse as well, but
to be honest I haven't gotten the workings of the mouse down yet. The code will build
heavily on the previous tutorial, since we are going to move a sprite around with the joystick,
but you don't need to understand the sprite parts of the code to understand the workings of
the joystick. If you don't know what a joystick is, or if you don't recognise the little sprite ship
used in the sample source, you are not allowed to read further. Please stop this instant and
browse the web for more generally related Atari information.

A while back, I thought the ST was so much cooler than your average PC, because with the
ST, you just have to plug in a joystick and it works. With a PC, you have to install drivers and
shit, and configure the exact joystick and generally mess around lots and perhaps even then
it won't work or the program you want to run doesn't support your joystick. All in all inferior
construction, or so I thought. Actually, with the ST, you also need to set up your own joystick
driver. In fact, since you usually don't have a hard drive and the OS (operating system)
doesn't have drivers for the joystick, every program needs it's own drivers for the joystick.
Writing the joystick driver isn't at all difficult, but you have to have some working knowledge
to do it.

There is a little 6301 processor inside the Atari ST, which takes care of the keyboard, the
mouse and the joystick. It even has a real time clock. This cute little chip is sometimes
referred to as the IKBD, for **I**ntelligent **K**ey**B**oar**D**. It might be fun to know that the IKBD has
4K (4096 bytes) of ROM memory, and 128 bytes of RAM. ROM stands for **R**ead **O**nly **M**emory,
and as it says, it's memory that can't be altered, RAM is **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory and it is that
which we usually mean by memory. The 128 bytes of RAM on the IKBD are only used as a
temporal storage area. The reason for having a separate chip altogether taking care of the
keyboard, mouse and joystick is that those actions won't burden the main processor (the
68000, the one we've been programming so far in these tutorials). Instead, we can poll the
IKBD as we choose, or tell it to report stuff in any way we choose, and just let the IKBD
worry about the details.

Our mission therefore is clear: we must find a way to make the IKBD report the status of the
joystick, and also find a way to read that status in some way. When that is accomplished, we
can use the sprite routine from the previous tutorial as it is, with only a change in the
`move_sprite` subroutine. The new subroutine will update the X and Y coordinates in
accordance with the joystick status instead of just moving it about.

Trap function 25 of the XBIOS will allow us to send commands to the IKBD. However, unlike
other trap calls, the input data is a pointer to a string of data. link:appendixes/ikbd.txt[IKBD Protocol] may
seem very sketchy and difficult to understand, but it does contain a list of all the possible
commands that you can send to the IKBD, taking a look inside it, we see function `$14`. IKBD
command `$14` will report joystick status every time the joystick is changed. All well and good,
this is how we set it up.

The first parameter is a pointer to the address which contains the commands, the second
parameter is the length in bytes of the command list minus one, in this case zero. Then the
function number, a trap calling XBIOS and a normal stack clean up. Sure, so now the joystick
reports information, but where does the information go? Well, actually we need to write our
own routine to read the joystick information.

Every time the joystick sends information, there is a jump to an address with instructions of
what to do with this data, compare this with the timers from <<tutorial-09#,tutorial 9>>.
Also, as with the timers, we will hook up our own routine to read the joystick. With trap
function 34 of the XBIOS, the IKBD returns a list of all its vectors. The address of the IKBD
vectors is put in `d0`. The joystick report vector is at offset 24, so by putting our own
joystick routine at the address pointed to by `d0`+24, we have effectively hooked up our
own joystick routine.

dc.l            old_joy                          ; old joy vector storage

Straightforward, first get the address of the IKBD vectors. Store it for future restoration. Then
put the address in a0 so that a0 points to the IKBD vectors, backup the old joystick vector
which is found at offset 24, and input our own joystick routine. By the way, the mouse vector
is at offset 16. With the help of this and the information given on the other IKBD commands
on appendices/ikbd.txt[IKBD Protocol], you should be able to setup your own mouse routine as well.

The joystick routine ends with an rts, nothing else, and may not take more than 1/100 of a
second (half a VBL, more than enough time really). What happens now is that each time the
joystick status is changed, the ST will jump to our joystick routine. Once there, `a0` will point
to three bytes in memory which contain the status of the joysticks.

The first of these bytes is a header telling us which joystick it was that did something. The
byte will contain `$FE` if joystick 0 did something, and `$FF` if it was joystick 1 (meaning the last
bit represents either joystick 0 or joystick 1). Remember, joystick 0 is the joystick port shared
with the mouse, and joystick 1 is the port exclusively for joysticks. The next two bytes
contain the actual information for the joysticks. The first one holds status for joystick 0, and
the other one for joystick 1. The data has this structure

[options="header",cols="8*^"]
|=========================
| F | 0 | 0 | 0 | R | L | D | U
| 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0
8+| (F = fire, R = right, L = left, D = down, U = up)
|=========================

So if bit 7 is set, the fire button was pressed, if bit 0 is set, the joystick is moved up, if bit 0,
2 and 7 are set, the joystick is moved up-right while the fire button is being pressed. Real
simple. Here's a joystick routine that will simply store the joystick data in memory, two
different variables could have been used instead of course (but this is good practice on
addressing modes).

That's it! Well, almost. We must restore our poor system, for one thing, it would be good to
turn the mouse back on :) When we turn on the joystick, the mouse is turned off. In order to
turn it on, we send command `$08` to the IKBD, to put the mouse in relative report mode,
which would probably be the default mode for the mouse then. While we're at it, might be
good to restore the joystick vector as well. For the curious lot out there, "mus" is Swedish for
mouse, and it's a suitable short form for mouse as well.

Two other commands of the IKBD that might be good to know about are `$1A`, which turns off
the joystick, and `$12` which turns off the mouse. Let's say we want to be on the really safe
side and not only turn on joystick reporting but also turn off mouse reporting, it would look
thusly

Note how the extra parameters are just appended to the command list, and the update of the
instruction length parameter to reflect the new command list length. Here comes the source

Yup, another long source code. There are big similarities between the sprite tutorial though,
since we're basically doing the same thing. The new things are of course the joystick on and
off, which are located between the "; joy code" comments, after the pre-shiftings. Nothing to
say there that hasn't been said before. Same with the joystick routine. The `move_sprite`
routine is all new and deserves attention.

It begins by moving the joystick data to `d0`. In this case, I only check joystick 1. First I begin
by checking for the fire button, this is done by seeing if `d0` contains a number larger than or
equal to 128. If the fire button is pressed, the 8th bit (bit 7, start counting from 0 and from
the rightmost bit) in the joystick status byte is set which means that the byte will hold a value
equal to or higher than 128, since `%10000000` = 128. Then I clear out the fire bit so that it
won't bother me anymore.

Next I check for joystick movement. This is done by using the same method as above. For
example, if the joystick is down-left, then bit 1 and 2 are set, meaning the byte will hold
value `%00000110` = 6. This is the reason for clearing out the fire bit above. If it hadn't been
cleared, the number would be either 6 or 128 + 6 = 134 for down-right. So just run through
all 8 directional checks to see if any bits are set, if they are not, I just branch right away to
done. If this branch hadn't been there, the program would just continue and execute the
code associated with joystick up if the joystick wasn't moved at all. An early bug that caused
me some confusion.

After the coordinates have been changed accordingly, I also check to see that the sprite isn't
out of bounds, since this could cause a crash and be generally stupid in all kinds of ways. So
just check if the coordinates are right, and if they're not, reset them to the closest correct
value. If you want a speedier ship, just increase the speed accordingly, adding more than one
to the coordinates, and also remember to include this in the boundary check, just as the
sprite.

Some of you will probably notice that the ship itself is not 32 scan lines, although I treat the
sprite as such. This has the effect of the ship never reaching all the way down the screen,
since there is some black space worth of sprite data. This could be easily fixed of course, but
I didn't. Also, two ships moving might be nice, at first I considered having both the Xenon 2
ship and the Xenon 1 ship side by side, controlled by two joysticks, but I decided to keep it
simple. However, there should be no big trouble incorporating that, and changing the fire
button perhaps to morph the Xenon 1 ship.

Having two sprites is no harder than having one sprite, the only thing you have to think about
is the order of painting the sprites, the ones painted first will be painted over by the ones that
come next. Yet another cool thing is to change the look of the sprite as you move it, like in
the real Xenon game, they have the ship tilted sideways and generate rocket fire when it
moves, all you need is a flag to know which state the ship is in and change the sprite address
accordingly.

This means having a sprite picture with not just one ship, but the ship tilted in directions and
with rocket flames, all in all lots of pictures. All of these sprites will of course fit in one degas
picture, so all you need is the correct offset into this picture depending on what "mode" the
sprite is in. Compare this to the way we address the sprite mask, only in this case it's a
different sprite (or different look of the sprite, depending on how you see it).

Now you have the tools needed to create a game, or even a demo for that matter: now go to
it! Even though there is still much to learn, the basics have been covered, all but one thing:
music and sound. It is my hope that this will come soon. But you don't have to worry about
that for now, code away and the music will be easily incorporated at a later stage.

Usually, you just hook up the music in your VBL routine. On the Dead Hackers Society page,
http://dhs.nu/, there are two chip editors (at least) with instructions on how to play the
generated music in assembler: Edsynth and the XLR8. Go take a look at them if you're
curious, there should be no trouble understanding the code.
